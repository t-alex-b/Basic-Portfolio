			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src="assets/images/pic o me.jpg" alt="Alex" class="myImage">
			<p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio page. I'm Alex and I am 28 years old, married for 2 years to my lovely wife Ivy, and
				the father of the sweetest baby-girl on the planet, Sparrow.</p>
			<p>I love playing music with friends and bandmates. I have been playing the guitar for my entire adult life and have picked
				up other instruments, including: drums, bass-guitar, and live power-electronics setups.</p>
			<p>Skateboarding is another lifelong interest of mine. There is nothing quite like screeching down the street on four hard
				urethane wheels. While I'm no professional, I have a handful of tricks to my name and will always be working on improvement.</p>
			<p>Web-developement is a new addition to my arsenal of skills but I am so excited to dive in and get my hands dirty. Hopefully
				this page will demonstrate at least an inkling of proclivity in said field. I know that I have a lot to learn and this
				is just the first cobblestone on the road to my future success.</p>
